# rt-mbms-modem

The MBMS Modem builds the lower part of the 5G-MAG Reference Tools. Its main task is to convert a 5G BC input signal (received as I/Q raw data from the SDR) to Multicast IP packets on the output.

**A detailed overview and the installation instructions can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/5G-MAG/Documentation-and-Architecture/wiki/MBMS-Modem).**
